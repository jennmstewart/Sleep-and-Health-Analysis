# Sleep and Health Analysis Project

### **Project Overview**
In this project, I analyzed a dataset focused on sleep patterns, health metrics, and lifestyle factors, aiming to uncover relationships between **sleep quality**, **physical activity**, **age**, **gender**, and other health-related data. This analysis was conducted using **Power BI**, where interactive visualizations were created to explore various health and sleep metrics.

### **Dataset**
The dataset consists of several health-related fields, including:
- **Age**: The age of individuals.
- **Bedtime**: The time individuals go to bed.
- **Calories Burned**: The total number of calories burned per day.
- **Daily Steps**: The number of steps taken per day.
- **Dietary Habits**: The dietary categories of individuals.
- **Gender**: The gender of individuals (Male or Female).
- **Medication Usage**: Whether individuals use medication.
- **Physical Activity Level**: The physical activity category (Low, Medium, High).
- **Sleep Disorders**: Whether an individual has reported sleep disorders.
- **Sleep Quality**: A rating of the individual's sleep quality.
- **Wake Up Time**: The time individuals wake up.

### **Objective**
The main objective of this project was to understand how various health and lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and age, correlate with sleep quality and






Sleep and Health Analysis Project
Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed a dataset focused on sleep patterns, health metrics, and lifestyle factors, aiming to uncover relationships between sleep quality, physical activity, age, gender, and other health-related data. This analysis was conducted using Power BI, where interactive visualizations were created to explore various health and sleep metrics.

Dataset
The dataset consists of several health-related fields, including:

Age: The age of individuals.
Bedtime: The time individuals go to bed.
Calories Burned: The total number of calories burned per day.
Daily Steps: The number of steps taken per day.
Dietary Habits: The dietary categories of individuals.
Gender: The gender of individuals (Male or Female).
Medication Usage: Whether individuals use medication.
Physical Activity Level: The physical activity category (Low, Medium, High).
Sleep Disorders: Whether an individual has reported sleep disorders.
Sleep Quality: A rating of the individualâ€™s sleep quality.
Wake Up Time: The time individuals wake up.
Objective
The main objective of this project was to understand how various health and lifestyle factors, such as physical activity and age, correlate with sleep quality and overall health. I aimed to answer the following questions:

How does sleep quality vary across different age groups?
Is there a relationship between physical activity levels and sleep quality?
What is the distribution of sleep disorders between males and females?
Do individuals with higher levels of physical activity burn more calories and experience better sleep quality?
Visualizations
To answer these questions, I created the following visualizations in Power BI:

Bar Chart: Sleep Quality by Age Group

This visualization shows how sleep quality differs across various age groups. The analysis reveals that younger individuals tend to report higher sleep quality, while older age groups show a decline in sleep quality.
Pie Chart: Sleep Disorders by Gender

This pie chart represents the distribution of sleep disorders between males and females. The analysis shows that the occurrence of sleep disorders is almost evenly split between genders, indicating no significant gender-based disparity in reported sleep issues.
Line Chart: Calories Burned by Wake-Up Time

This line chart tracks the trend of calories burned based on the time individuals wake up. The analysis helps identify whether there is a pattern between early wake-up times and higher calorie expenditure.
Scatter Plot: Calories Burned vs. Sleep Quality

This scatter plot explores the relationship between calories burned and sleep quality. The analysis suggests a positive correlation between higher calorie burn and better sleep quality, indicating that individuals with higher physical activity levels tend to experience improved sleep.
Slicer: Filter by Physical Activity Level

An interactive slicer allows users to filter all visualizations by physical activity level (Low, Medium, High). This feature makes it easy to explore how different activity levels impact sleep quality, calorie burn, and other health metrics.
Insights
From this analysis, several important insights were discovered:

Sleep Quality and Age: Sleep quality tends to decline as individuals age. Younger participants generally reported better sleep quality, while older participants were more likely to report poorer sleep.
Physical Activity and Sleep: There is a strong correlation between physical activity levels and sleep quality. Individuals with higher levels of physical activity (as measured by calories burned and daily steps) reported better sleep quality compared to those with lower activity levels.
Sleep Disorders by Gender: Sleep disorders were equally prevalent among both males and females, showing no significant gender differences.
Calories Burned and Sleep Quality: The analysis suggests that individuals who burn more calories tend to experience better sleep quality, further reinforcing the importance of physical activity for overall well-being.
Tools and Technologies
This project was developed using the following tools and technologies:

Power BI: For data visualization and interactive report generation.
GitHub: To store and share the project files, including the Power BI report and project description.
Conclusion
This analysis highlights the significant impact that physical activity, age, and other factors have on sleep quality. By leveraging the power of data visualization in Power BI, I was able to transform raw data into meaningful insights that can be used by health professionals, wellness programs, or individuals seeking to improve their sleep habits and overall health.
